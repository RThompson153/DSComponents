A compilation of Blazor UI components.

# Note
I am currently the only person working on this project and am juggling this as well as a full time job as well.  I am trying to do regular releases, but at this point, I can't provide a reliable schedule.  If you would like direct communication on releases, please let me know, otherwise, updates will come with the NuGet Gallery. Additionally, if you would like to provide feedback or suggestions, feel free to email me at [devshedhelp@gmail.com](mailto:devshedhelp@gmail.com).

# Additional Instructions
This component library was built to focus primarily on functionality and allow for full css customization by the end user.  In that regard, there are no CSS colors, font styles, etc within the components themselves.  Instead, a collection of classes are exposed to allow the end user to give the desired styling.  The current list of styles is as follows:

.error - Error rule
.disabled - Disabled rule
.dsc-text - Text & font rule
.dsc-background - Background rule
